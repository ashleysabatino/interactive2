<p>our first swim was the last swim of summer. you said i needed boys that smelt like the sea; now that they are gone and you are right
memories lurk down by the wooden boats. things i didn’t know about;</p>
<strong>i hate not knowing everything.</strong>
it is a reminder that the world exists <em>without</em> me,
<h5>that i am not a part of</h5><h4> everything.</h4>
if only i had known then you can only romanticise something when it’s gone, like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.
i will shut my eyes, <h1>open my legs</h1>
and view the world as i see it.
<p>i find myself wishing there was only one place
i had ever known you so i could destroy it.
there are too many places that have part of me.
we drove back the following night and you said we had won and i knew by you saying it 
that we <em>hadn’t.</em>
