<p>our first swim was the last swim of summer. 
<br><br><br>you said i needed boys that
<br>smelt like the sea;
<br><br><br><br>now that they are gone
<br>and you are right</p>
<p>memories lurk down by the wooden boats.
<br>things i didn’t know about;
<br><br><br>i hate not knowing everything.
<br><br>it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br>that i am not a part of everything.
<br>if only i had known then
<br><br><br><br>you can only romanticise something when it’s gone,
<br>like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.
<br><br><br><br>i will shut my eyes, open my legs
<br>and view the world as i see it.
<br>i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>i had ever known you
<br><br><br><br>so i could destroy it.
<br><br>there are too many places that have part of me.
<br>we drove back the following night and you said
<br>we had won
<br>and i knew by you saying it 
<br><br>that we hadn’t.
