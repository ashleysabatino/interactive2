our first swim was the last swim of summer<strong>.</strong> you said <em>i</em> needed boys that smelt like the sea<strong>;</strong> now that they are gone and you are right
memories lurk down by the wooden boats<strong>.</strong> things <em>i</em> didn<strong>’</strong>t know about<strong>;</strong>
<em>i</em> hate not knowing everything<strong>.</strong>
it is a reminder that the world exists without me<strong>,</strong>
that <em>i</em> am not a part of everything<strong>.</strong>
if only <em>i</em> had known then you can only romanticise something when it<strong>’</strong>s gone<strong>,</strong> like some kind of consolation prize for your loss<strong>.<strong>
<em>i</em> will shut my eye<strong>,</strong> open my legs
and view the world as <em>i</em> see it</strong>.</strong>
<em>i</em> find myself wishing there was only one place
<em>i</em> had ever known you so <em>i</em> could destroy it<strong>.</strong>
there are too many places that have part of me<strong>.</strong>

that we hadn<strong>’</strong>t<strong>.</srong>
