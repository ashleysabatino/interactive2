<p>our first <br>swim was the <br>last swim of <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>summer. 
<br><br><br><br>you said i needed boys that
<br><br><br>smelt like <br><br><br><br>the <br><br>sea;
<br><br><br><br>now that they are gone
<br><br><br>and you are right</p>
<p>memories lurk down by the <br><br>wooden boats.
<br>things i didn’t <br>know <br>about<br><br><br><br><br>;
<br><br><br>i hate not knowing <br><br><br>everything.
<br><br>it is a reminder that <br>the world <br>exists without me,
<br>that i am not a part of everything.
<br><br><br><br>if only i had known then
<br><br><br><br>you can only romanticise something <br>when it’s gone,
<br>like some kind of consolation prize for your <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>loss.
<br><br><br><br>i will shut my eyes, <br><br><br><br><br>open my legs
<br><br><br><br>and view the world as i see it.
<br>i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br><br>i <br><br>had <br>ever <br><br>known <br><br><br>you
<br><br><br><br>so i could destroy it.
<br><br>there are too many places that have part of me.
<br>we drove back the following night <br>and you said
<br>we had <br><br><br>won
<br>and i knew by you saying it 
<br><br>that <br>we <br><br>hadn’t.
