<p>our first swim was the last swim of summer. you said i needed boys that smelt like the sea; now that they are gone and you are right</p>
<p>memories lurk down by the wooden boats. things i didn’t know about;
<br><br><br>i hate not knowing everything.
<br><br><br>it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br><br><br>that i am not a part of everything.
<br><br><br>if only i had known then you can only romanticise something when it’s gone, like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.
<br><br><br><br><br>i will shut my eyes, 
<br><br><br><br><br>open my legs
<br><br><br><br><br>and view the world as i see it.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>i had ever known you so i could destroy it.
<br><br>there are too many places that have part of me. we drove back the following night and you said we had won and i knew by you saying it 
<br><br>that we hadn’t.
