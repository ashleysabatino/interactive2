<h5>our first swim was the last swim of summer. you said i needed boys that smelt like the sea; now that they are gone and you are right</h5>
<h4>memories lurk down by the wooden boats. things i didn’t know about;
i hate not knowing everything.
it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
that i am not a part of everything.</h4>
<h3>if only i had known then you can only romanticise something when it’s gone, like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.
i will shut my eyes, open my legs
and view the world as i see it.</h3>
<h2>i find myself wishing there was only one place
i had ever known you so i could destroy it.
there are too many places that have part of me. <h2>
<h2>we drove back the following night and you said we had won and i knew by you saying it 
that we </h2><h1>hadn’t.</h1>
