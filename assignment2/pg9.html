<h5>our first swim was the last swim of summer. </h5>
<h4>you said i needed boys that
<br>smelt like the sea;</h4>
<h3>now that they are gone
<br>and you are right</p></h3>
<h4>memories lurk down by the wooden boats.
<br>things i didn’t know about;</h4>
<h3>i hate not knowing</h3><h2> everything.</h2>
<h3>it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br>that i am not a part of everything.</h3>
<h4>if only i had known then
<br>you can only romanticise something when it’s gone,
<br>like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.<h4>
<h5>i will shut my eyes, open my legs
<br>and view the world as i see it.</h5>
<h4>i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>i had ever known you<h4>
<h3>so i could destroy it.</h3>
<h4>there are too many places that have part of me.
<br>we drove back the following night and you said
<br>we had won</h4>
<h5>and i knew by you saying it 
<br>that we hadn’t.</h5>
