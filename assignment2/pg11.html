<div style="padding:20px;float:left;">our first swim was the last swim of summer.
<br>you said i needed boys that
<br>smelt like the sea;</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">now that they are gone
<br>and you are right
<br>memories lurk down by the wooden boats.</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:300px;">things i didn’t know about;
<br>i hate not knowing everything.
<br>it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br>that i am not a part of everything.</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">if only i had known then
<br>you can only romanticise something when it’s gone,
<br>like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">i will shut my eyes, open my legs
<br>and view the world as i see it.</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>i had ever known you</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">so i could <h6><em>destroy</h6></em> it.</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">here are too many places that have part of me.
<br>we drove back the following night and you said
<br>we had won</div>
<div style="padding:20px;float:left;margin:100px;">and i knew by you saying it that we hadn’t.</div>
