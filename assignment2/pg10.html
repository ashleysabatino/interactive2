<h2>our first swim was the last swim of summer. </h2>
<h4>you said <strong>i</strong> needed boys that
<br>smelt like the<strong>sea</strong>;</h4>
<h3>now that they are g<strong>o</strong>ne
<br>and you are right</p></h3>
<h4>memories lurk d<strong>o</strong>wn by the w<em>oo</em>den boats.
<br>things i didn’t know about;</h4>
<h2>i <strong>hate</strong> not knowing</h2><h1> everyth<em>i</em>ng.</h1>
<h3>it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br>that i am <strong>not</strong> a part of everything.</h3>
<h4>if only i had known then
<br>you can only <strong>romantic</strong><em>ise</em> something when it’s gone,
<br>like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.<h4>
<h1>i will shut my eyes, <em>open my legs</em>
<br>and view the world as <strong>i</strong> see <strong>it</strong>.</h1>
<h4>i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>i had ever known you<h4>
<h3>so i could</h3> <h1>destroy</h1><h3> it.</h3>
<h5>there are too many places that have part of me.
<br>we drove back the following night and you said
<br>we had won</h5>
<h4>and i knew by you saying it 
<br>that we hadn’t.</h4>
