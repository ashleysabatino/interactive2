<p><br>Our first swim was the last swim of summer.
<br>You said I needed boys that
<br>Smelt like the sea;
<br>Now that they are gone
<br>And you are right
<br>Memories lurk down by the wooden boats.
<br>Things I didn’t know about;
<br>I hate not knowing everything.
<br>It is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br>That I am not a part of everything.
<br>If only I had known then
<br>You can only romanticise something when it’s gone,
<br>Like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.
<br>I will shut my eyes, open my legs
<br>And view the world as I see it.
<br>I find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>I had ever known you
<br>So I could destroy it.
<br>There are too many places that have part of me.
<br>We drove back the following night and you said
<br>We had won
<br>And I knew by you saying it that we hadn’t.
