<p><br>our first swim was the last swim of summer.
<br>you said I needed boys that
<br>smelt like the sea;
<br>now that they are gone
<br>and you are right
<br>memories lurk down by the wooden boats.
<br>things I didn’t know about;
<br>i hate not knowing everything.
<br>it is a reminder that the world exists without me,
<br>that I am not a part of everything.
<br>if only I had known then
<br>you can only romanticise something when it’s gone,
<br>like some kind of consolation prize for your loss.
<br>i will shut my eyes, open my legs
<br>and view the world as I see it.
<br>i find myself wishing there was only one place
<br>i had ever known you
<br>so I could destroy it.
<br>there are too many places that have part of me.
<br>we drove back the following night and you said
<br>we had won
<br>and I knew by you saying it that we hadn’t.
