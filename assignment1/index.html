  <br><h3>attempt one</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Courier;font-size:12px;width: 600px;">my first attempts were to republish the text over inappropriate images. i took the first page of fight club by chuck palahniuk and typed the text over the first handful of images of 'pink' images on WeHeartIt.com While playing around with the "image-based social network for inspiring images" site We Heart It i discovered they have a tool to send "postcards" to people.

<br><h3>attempt two</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Courier;font-size:12px;width: 600px;">my second attempt was part experiment, part anonymous performance. i went on the notorious chat site www.omegele.com and attempted to type as far into the first chapter of fight club by chuck palahniuk as i could. unfortunately, i don't think i talkd to a single real human being during these recordings. i'm almost positive they were all spam robots.
