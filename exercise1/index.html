Make sure your hair is long. If it is not, consider growing it out and putting in cute seashell barrettes or green ribbons (like seaweed) in the meantime. Either way, make sure to have healthy glossy hair. Never look like you have just stepped out of a salon, because mermaids don't go there. Never apply mousse or gel to your hair either, it will look unnatural and fake. If you want, you can also use kool-aid to dye your hair in oceanic colors, like green and blue. just remember not to add the sugar or use the sugar free kind. sugar free kool-aid has artificial sweeteners in it.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">2 Always wear aquatic jewelry, which makes people think of the ocean. You can buy these things at Claire's or even Dollar Tree! If you want really realistic aquatic jewelry, you should look on Etsy.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">3 Paint your nails blues and greens, or mood changing nail polish. Or go natural with a clear coat of clear polish.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">4 Wear blues, greens, and purples. For bottoms you should wear long flowing skirts or pants, never shorts or leggings. It will give the impression you're hiding something on your legs, like scales. You can wear any kind of top, but make sure it doesn't have any brand names on them.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">5 Act alert around water. If you happen to get a drop of water on you, run away to hide in the bathroom or frantically dry it off. When the class is talking about the ocean, listen intently like you already know these things, but you're looking to point out a mistake. Or, to be mysterious, clam up completely.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">6 Bring a journal to school about your mermaid life. Write how you became a mermaid, how you transform, your experiences, etc. Include sketches of your tail, too. When your friends ask what it is, quickly say it is nothing and change the subject. One day, leave it lying around so your friend takes it. When she asks about it, laugh nervously and say that it's your "planning journal" for a mermaid story you're writing. Ask for it back and give a little sigh.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">7 Wear natural makeup. It may be tempting to wear blue or green eyeshadow on your lids, but please don't. Keep it looking natural with a shimmering eyeshadow (bronze or gold colored), matte lipstick, mascara, a rosy blush, and concealer to cover any imperfections you may have.</p></li></ul>

				<p style="width:600px;">8 Be an amazing singer! Mermaids stereotypically sing beautifully so you want to be really good at it. Make sure you don't sing too much or too loudly because people will think you are a show-off.</p></li></ul>
